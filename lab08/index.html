            <p>
                My name is Caribel Florentino. Im a junior majoring in <strong>applied data analytics</strong> with an interest in cybersecurity and cloud computing. 
                I have experience in Python and Microsoft Excel and have made it to the Deans List at the School of Information Studies. 
                Additionally, I received a merit scholarship and am a member of the LSAMP program. I have two twin sisters who are also attending Syracuse University; they are currently sophomores. 
                In my free time, I love reading and watching older movies. Some of my favorite books include The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, and Poet X. As for movies and TV shows, I enjoy Waves, Se7en, Love, Rosie, and High Fidelity.
