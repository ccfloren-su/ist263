                    The first recipe is Japanese cheesecake! This cake will absolutely blow your mind solely based on the texture and taste alone. 
                    If you love cheesecake, but love the texture of a soft cloud, this is the perfect recipe for you. 
                    It’s one of the easiest cakes you’ll ever make and there’s only 6 ingredients necessary. 
                    It’s also a legendary recipe when it comes to Asian desserts and there are entire stores like Uncle Tetsu that are dedicated to making only Japanese cheesecakes. 
                    If you’re worried about how long it’ll take to make, the prep time is 20 minutes and it takes an hour to bake, so you can make it in a jiff.
